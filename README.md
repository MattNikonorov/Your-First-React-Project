This is the github repository for this tutorial: https://dev.to/code_jedi/your-first-react-project-206n

To start working with this project, run `npx create-react-app react-project` in your terminal, this will create a react project structure for you, then navigate to `src/index.js` and change it to this repository's index.js file.

To launch your react local development server, open a new terminal window in your react project folder and run `npm start`.
